Introduction

Autoura are an autonomous car platform whose aim is to allow users to access their vehicles for purposes of sightseeing. Of course, with the current technology, this is a concept for the future when the technology is readily available to the public market. This was an intriguing idea which I was interested in pursuing, so I attended a talk hosted by the creator of Autoura. This was a great benefit as I was able to understand what was expected and what could be done as I was able to communicate directly.

Autonomous and/or self-driving cars have been in the process of completion for the last two years, with Tesla intricating this into their current fleet of production vehicles. Using this as a base for my proposal, these cars operate with a large tablet in the dashboard, these tablets are renowned to be the best operating interfaces in vehicles today, where users are able to use the seventeen-inch tablet to view maps, their music library and operate the settings of the car easily. 
Could it be possible to use this interface for an application that would allow users to book a ride, enter and visit their desired points of interest without driving there themselves? 

Current taxi’s and the London Underground have pro’s and con’s to their use. Environmentally they are damaging especially within a city such as London. Autonomous cars such as Tesla are electrically powered meaning they have no effect, this could mean that multiple travelling throughout a city would allow no fees for congestion charges. This would be a massive positive effect for Autoura. This would certainly represent well publicly. User’s may be interested to try this system for travelling around their desired city, using the interface provided being able to plan their route whilst visiting points of interest. Users could be able to plan to be dropped off then picked up from excursions and attractions, booking a time allocation. Then they will be able to carry on with their route. 


Design Inspiration 


Whilst starting the project, thoughts were that this is a concept had not been represented on a wide, mass-market scale. I didn’t have any source that I could refer to for this system as autonomous driving vehicles is technology that hasn’t been made available to the public. 

To gain research and knowledge, time was spent observing current travel applications and webpages. The first that was explored was researching Uber, this is a platform which allows users to request a ride by local drivers in their area, the user is able to select their pick-up point and destination. The application is well designed with a simple to use layout, users are able to easily understand how to book a ride, on the homepage a map is displayed alongside a search bar with the placeholder being ‘Where?’; this gives the user a visual cue of where they would like to go. Using geolocation, will then show where the user is and ask them to request a pickup point, this is implemented by the pre-built GPS that is installed into a mobile device. geolocation is a great advantage to the user having to manually input their address; this is simply a time saving method. Uber was an inspiration as it has changed how we perceive travel, essentially changing a system which taxis have used to navigate. Changing this for the convenience of the user alongside prices being lower to users. 

Following this, I explored how users would use an application that would allow them to compare possible points of interest, a great example of this is Trip Advisor, users are able to add reviews and recommendations on multiple categories. Upon arrival of the homepage you can search which city you are interested in, this will then show an image of the selected city which covers the upper portion of the screen. Users from here are able to then select the multiple categories within the selected city. This shows reviews, pictures and general information on the point of interest, this will help the user to gauge if they would like to visit the location. Trip Advisor is simply laid out for the convenience of the user, with the use of basic colours such as White and Green helps to give the user a clear idea on how to operate the webpage. The psychology of colours is well implemented into webpages, colour psychology is described as a how a person will feel due to seeing a colour. When webpages are being created by a team of developers, they will look at the current market and/or competitors to see what common and uncommon features of colour are used throughout.

Affordance was a preference that was well explored, the decision was made to have affordance within the site as this would allow the user an ease of use and comfortability to the wide range of users – which may have had no to limited knowledge all the way up to the accustomed and frequent user. Affordances are visual cues to how an object on a webpage should be used easily and without explanation to the user; this should be a simple interaction leading to no confusion. An example that can be given of this is a search icon, this can be a simple button when hovered over by the user; it will indicate the user to click down on this button, by either changing colour or a shadow dropping when clicked. This is something that when well executed allows an ease of use to the page. 


User Research


To gain research into whether the public thought that Autoura’s concept was worthwhile, I conducted public interviews where I would ask members of the public if they were able to partake in a helping me gain a base of understanding. Spending on total three hours gaining information, I was able to ask twelve persons their thoughts and understanding on autonomous cars. This was a very split decision between my interview groups, half understood how the technology worked through seeing this through media and the other half not understanding how this is possible and safe. This left me in a position where I was expecting from the negative answered questions the same responses, users felt that how was the car’s technology would be able to consciously make the right decision if an incident happened, asking if the occupants of the car would then be responsible for that accident; positively answered responses were also lenient to this thought. This shows that the public are sceptical to this technology currently but with the evolvement of it throughout the last couple years and the future proposals of this technology, it could certainly become a reality. 
User personas were created to understand how different backgrounds would be able to use the application. This was fairly easy to understand that the application would need to support multiple languages this would allow for the wider market to be represented. This is already an issue a foreign speakers may face such as using the London Underground, as it is a complicated metro system, tourists may become lost or confused as all signs and information are displayed in English. We want to allow the foreign speaker to interact with our application and concept to allow them to travel to points of interest with confidence that they will arrive safely and with knowledge given to them through the interface provided. One of the personas travels London by using Uber and the Underground, this runs up high fees in the long run. He is a café owner who likes to eat out and compare his own café to others. The persona is willing to try out this concept as it is new and may offer them ease in their travelling to multiple locations for a cheaper price. 
Users tested the application and overall it was discovered that ease of use was fluid throughout pages. The use of content being displayed and not hidden within menus was well received also. Criticisms included were all necessary for the further development of the application, such as the idea of showing the car and the number plate so users would easily be able to notice what car would be collecting them. Through testing a user said when booking their route, they are able to understand through the map how long their journey may take and that there may be traffic on the route. But including this in style of an animation would make any user with whatever knowledge understand what may happen on their trip.


Reflection


Sketch and Invision were the software’s that were used to create the application, these both link together to allow for prototype applications to be viewed as if they had been completed by a back-end developer. These are both free tools which allow ease of use for a creator to explore different methods of creation. 
Creating the prototype within this project, I felt that I had dealt with this task in a professional manner, with contributions from the interviews I held, being listened to and discussed, I was the deciding factor to what was going to be implemented. With more focus and experience, I am certain that this prototype would have been constructed across all viewports.  For the prototype, the main area of improvement would have been designing a mobile based version, this would have been better to represent such a current and diverse market, the modern-day phone user relies on their device for more than communicating, for example, Uber are a great example of this, with statistics showing that in the sixty five countries operated there are fifteen million Uber trips completed everyday – with Autoura this could follow suit with the idea of autonomous driving. Allow for tourism to grow in cities, with a futureproof technology. 
Hamburger menus are a common day sight on mobile webpages and applications, the reasoning behind this is due to the limited amount of space on a mobile device, since the age of responsive design, a website can be implemented into any browser or device. UI designers currently use an approach known as ‘mobile-first’, this helps to keep the interface clean and simple, likewise helping it to work over all devices. To argue this, this is a trend I was interested in trying to halt. In previous works I had used these frequently. As I was creating this on a tablet screen I felt that for this scenario, it would not be necessary for these to be included or implemented into the final design of the application. Autoura will want to represent as wide an market as possible so in making the application the user will be suggested by the visual cues how to navigate, this is the simplest way to make this accessible to a user with no or high knowledge on tablet viewports.
An idea for the final product which was explored was by using algorithms, the user could fill out a short survey, this would ask them what landmarks interested them, then show a wide selection of places for the user to choose through. This could support ease of use for the application. When creating this it was decided that this task would need to be well implemented as we do not want the user to think that they are be categorised, this is could have a negative effect on how the user perceives Autoura.
Finally, for the future an idea that wasn’t carried out, was allowing users to select through multiple languages, this would further the field of the market represented. Per say, if a tourist who only spoke French, they would be able to access the tablet in this language, the information from the English site would be simply translated to show the content understandable to the user. This would be done by the user selecting the UK flag in the top corner of the page, this would then open a drop-down menu where the user would then select the French flag; translating the page. This supports further in gaining a wider range of popularity for tourists looking to explore, possibly even having a text to speech dictation which would be selected, then this would be spoken to the user through the audio interface installed in the ride. Allowing the user to view the points of interest whilst being told about their history and other relevant information.
